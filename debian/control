Description: Open Test Alliance API
 Open source project to provide a minimal common foundation for testing
 libraries on the JVM. The primary goal of the project is to enable testing
 frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, Spock, etc. and third-party assertion
 libraries like Hamcrest, AssertJ, etc. to use a common set of exceptions
 that IDEs and build tools can support in a consistent manner across all
 testing scenarios -- for example, for consistent handling of failed
 assertions and failed assumptions as well as visualization of test execution
 in IDEs and reports.
